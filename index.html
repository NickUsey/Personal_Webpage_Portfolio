      <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
          Greetings and Welcome!! This is my first webpage as a student in the MIT Full Stack Developement course. 
          Within the confines of this page you will find an introductory video where I will discuss a little on myself, what I am currently learning and my goals. 
          After which you then find a list of my projects that I have worked on thus far. A separate page for those specific projects are available on the navigation 
          bar up top as well as a dropdown showing links to their respective repositories. At the bottom of the page there are some links to my personal GitHub and LinkedIn 
          profiles to show my work and the course of my professional carrerr thus far. Thank you for visiting this site and I hope you enjoy!!

      <h3>Bio</h3>
        <p>
          I'm from a small town named Hammond in southeastern Louisiana. 
          I have lived here for the majority of my life, but I love to travel often around the country with my wife. 
          I work as an Auto Claims Adjuster for Progressives NCRT were I adjust claims for their CAT team.
          Insurance was a career that I went into after college, but in recent years I have developed my interests in programming
          where I am finding an outlet for my creative and scientific side. I also train daily as a martial artist, practicing 
          Shotokan Karate for the last 16 years. I have obtained the rank of 2nd degree black belt and am working on obtaining my license to 
          teach. My career goal is to become a Software Engineer and find a company where I can feel valued, call home, and to develope my skills
          as a programmer even further beyond the scope of the education training. 
        </p>
